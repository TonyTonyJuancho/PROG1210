# PROG1180 - Project Planning & Design
This assignment was all about creating a website for a lawnmower company to help them eliminate the paper trail from all the aspect on how they were running the business. 
P.S.- A working database was not required for this course and everything had to be done using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Access to the website:**
**Admin:**
username: admin@email.com
Password: password1

**Technician:**
username: tech@email.com
Password: password1

**Sales:**
